        <h1>UW Street Smart - Neighbour Letter Template</h1>
        <p><strong>Helping Local Families Save Money on Their Bills</strong></p>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <p><strong>Dear Neighbour,</strong></p>

        <p>I hope this letter finds you well. My name is <strong>[YOUR NAME]</strong> and I live locally in <strong>[YOUR AREA]</strong>.</p>

        <p>I'm writing because I've been helping families in our neighbourhood save money on their household bills, and I wanted to let you know about an opportunity that could benefit you too.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>ðŸ’¡ What I Do</h3>
            <p>I'm partnered with Utility Warehouse (UW), a company that helps people reduce their bills with major providers like British Gas, BT, and many others. My role is simply to check if local families are eligible for savings.</p>
        </div>

        <p>I've already helped several of your neighbours who were getting fed up with paying a fortune for their utility bills. The process is straightforward:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Quick Check:</strong> I can check your postcode to see if you qualify for better rates</li>
            <li><strong>No Obligation:</strong> There's absolutely no pressure - if you're not saving money, you're not interested</li>
            <li><strong>Local Support:</strong> I'm your local contact for any questions or support</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="contact-info">
            <h3>ðŸ“ž How to Get Started</h3>
            <p><strong>Option 1:</strong> Scan the QR code below for a 60-second eligibility check</p>
            <p><strong>Option 2:</strong> Give me a call on <strong>[YOUR PHONE]</strong> to arrange a quick chat</p>
            <p><strong>Option 3:</strong> I'll be in the area this week and can pop by if convenient</p>
        </div>

        <p>I understand you're probably busy, so I've made this as simple as possible. It literally takes 2 minutes to check if you could be saving money.</p>

        <p>If you're not interested, that's totally fine - just pop this letter in the recycling. But if you'd like to see if you could be saving money, I'm here to help.</p>

        <p>Looking forward to hearing from you!</p>

        <p>Best regards,<br>
        <strong>[YOUR NAME]</strong><br>
        <em>Your Local UW Partner</em></p>
